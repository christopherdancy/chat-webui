Technical Details
This POC uses:

React for the UI
A simple rule-based intent parser (instead of a real LLM in this POC)
Simulated deployment (no actual hosting in this POC)

Next Steps for a Production Version

Integrate with a real LLM API (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
Add more sophisticated website components and templates
Implement actual deployment to Netlify/Vercel
Add authentication and user accounts
Support more customization options (images, layouts, etc.)
